README
    SnakeGame by Veny, is a Web Browser Game. The instructions are listed on how the game is played.
    There is no need to download or install to play the game
    The SnakeGame uses simple HTML, CSS and Javascript
    There was no need to use a canvas tag for this game.
    The game arena is built using css using a display grid, which is 25 x 25.
    The snake will apear within the grid which is located on top of a image.
    The image is designed to give the feel that the snake is in the wilderness hunting for food.
    The snake appears on the screen, and so does the food. The food appears randomly inside the grid.
    The user can use the arrow key to control the snake within the grid.
    If the user runs of the grid it will result in a game over.
    If the user runs into itself it will result in a game over.
    If the user runs out of time, it will result in a game over.
    If the user scores 10 points, eats, or runs into 10 peices of food it will result in a Win.

BUGS
    A bug that i want to fix is to start the timer as soon as the player press one of the arrow keys, or add a click function to the start game link on the navbar.

FUTURE FEATURES
    In the future, i would like to add a way to store the highest score of the user.
    Also would like to add another level as the user wins the games and scores points.
    I would like to add different images towards the snake and food items.
    I would like to also add sound to the game.
